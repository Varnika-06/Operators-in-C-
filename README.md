# Operators-in-C++
Experiment No.: 3
Name: Operations with Operators in C++
Tools Used: VS Code 
program 1: This C++ program takes the last 5 digits of your PRN as input and prints each digit in reverse order. It uses the modulus and division operations to extract and display digits one by one from the least significant to the most significant.
Theory of program 1: This program demonstrates the concept of extracting digits from an integer using loops and arithmetic operations. It also reinforces the use of:
i. `while` loop for repetition
ii. `%` (modulus) to get the last digit
iii. `/` (division) to remove the last digit
ALgorithm:
Step 1. Start the program.
Step 2. Input a 5-digit number (last 5 digits of PRN).
Step 3. Use a loop to repeat until the number becomes 0:
   - Extract the last digit using `% 10`.
   - Print the digit.
   - Remove the last digit using `/ 10`.
Step 4. End the program.
